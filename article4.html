    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
        <p>A computer is an electronic <em>device</em> that can store, process, and share information very quickly. It works with the help of hardware and software, following instructions to perform different tasks. Computers are used in schools, offices, hospitals, and even at home for learning, working, and entertainment. They also help people connect with others around the world through the internet. With their <i>speed and accuracy</i>, computers have become an important part of everyday life.</p>

    <h2>Genratioins of Computers</h2>
    <section>
        <p>The <strong>history of computers</strong> is divided into five generations, each marked by major technological advancements. The first generation <b>(1940s–1950s)</b> used vacuum tubes and was very large and slow. The second generation (1950s–1960s) replaced vacuum tubes with transistors, making computers smaller and faster. The third generation (1960s–1970s) introduced integrated circuits, which improved performance and reliability. The fourth generation (1970s–present) used microprocessors, leading to the development of personal computers. The fifth generation, still evolving, focuses on <u>artificial intelligence</u>, advanced processing, and modern technologies like robotics and machine learning.</p>

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <section>
        <blockquote>The internet was born in the late 1960s with the creation of <small>ARPANET</small>, a project by the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Department of Defense to connect computers for sharing information. Over time, this network grew and developed into a global system, allowing people to communicate, share data, and <cite>access information from anywhere in the world.</cite></blockquote>

    <h2>mathematic in computing</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Mathematics plays a vital <i>role in computing</i>, as it provides the foundation for algorithms, programming, and problem-solving. Concepts like algebra, logic, probability, and statistics help computers process data and make accurate decisions. Mathematics is used in areas such as cryptography for security, graphics for images and animations, and <b>artificial intelligence</b> for learning patterns. Without mathematics, the development of computer science and modern technologies would not be possible. E=mc<sup>2</sup>& H<sub>2</sub>o</p>
